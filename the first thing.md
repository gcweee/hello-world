# hello-world
first use of this website

My first sight with this website was almost one month ago, when I decided to learn Python which has been teaching by Teacher FangJin.
To be honest, this web seemed to be a useful but extramely difficult to control, just like Python.
I got nothing in my last 24 years. As for now, I want to make some change.
I convince myself to be good friends with English.
This is the website of myself. I will do my best to make it better and better.
Come on!
